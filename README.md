# Movie-Recommendation-System-Web-App
 
The Movie Recommendation System Web App is a user-friendly platform that provides personalized movie recommendations to users based on their previously liked movies. Whether you're a cinephile looking for your next favorite film or just someone seeking entertainment options, my web app has got you covered.

## How It Works ##

The Movie Recommendation System uses content based filtering techniques to suggest movies based on previous movie preferences. It compares the inputted movies togeter to extract features similar in order to suggest a new movie that the user may like.
